  //   Let's observe the behavior of the class in the above code.
    
  //   1. Handles the logic for notebooks. Such as adding pages, deleting pages, and getting page count.
  //   2. Parsing the code to JSON, String.
  //   3. Saving the Code to S3 or some file.
    
  //   If we observe functions like toS3(), there might be other classes that require the same functionality as well, such as a Diary Class? We might write the same code for the other class that might require the same functionality.
    
  //   Do you see the problem here? There is no code reusability a single class has too many functions and writing and persisting are tightly coupled to each other in this implementation.
    
  //   This implementation over time will lead to the formation of a "God Class", where a single class is doing too much work. This leads to difficulty in fixing bugs, specialized implementations for every single class, and not generic implementations.
    
  //   We can fix these issues by thinking of different functionalities as different classes or different responsibilities, that handle only that set of related functionalities. Like a persistence class, a different class to create Notebook objects.
